To restore from a checkpoint (for incremental training) first copy your checkpoint
files from S3 into this directory. Then edit src/train_mabs.py and specify the
checkpoint from which you would like to restore (~line 47).

You must copy the checkpoint directory in its entirety. For example:


sh-4.2$ pwd
/home/ec2-user/SageMaker/battlesnake_rllib/checkpoints

sh-4.2$ ls
checkpoint_10   checkpoint_140  checkpoint_190  checkpoint_230  checkpoint_50  events.out.tfevents.1584848117.algo-1
checkpoint_100  checkpoint_150  checkpoint_20   checkpoint_240  checkpoint_60  params.json
checkpoint_110  checkpoint_160  checkpoint_200  checkpoint_250  checkpoint_70  params.pkl
checkpoint_120  checkpoint_170  checkpoint_210  checkpoint_30   checkpoint_80  progress.csv
checkpoint_130  checkpoint_180  checkpoint_220  checkpoint_40   checkpoint_90  result.json



With the checkpoint files in place, we could then specify "checkpoint_250" as the restore point in
src/train_mabs.py:


<snip>
        return {
          "training": { 
            "env": "MultiAgentBattlesnake-v1",
            "restore": "/opt/ml/code/checkpoints/checkpoint_250/checkpoint-250",  # <- HERE 
            "run": "PPO",
            "stop": {
              "training_iteration": self.num_iters,
            },
</snip>



The 'restore' path above references "/opt/ml/code/checkpoints/" as this is the path into
which the checkpoint files will be copied within the SageMaker training container, during
your training job.
