## Deploy a pretrained snake AI into your AWS account

This section will deploy a pre-trained AI on a Lambda function. An API Gateway will be created in front of it to provide a snake API entripoint (see [BattleSnake API](https://docs.battlesnake.com/snake-api)).

Use the links below to deploy the model in the region you like:

_* the official BattleSnake platform run in us-west-2, selecting this one will provide you the lowest latency_

_You need to be logged into the AWS account where you want to deploy the stack._

Check all permissions:

![Accept Permissions](https://github.com/awslab/sagemaker-battlesnake-ai/raw/master/Documentation/images/create-stack.png "Permission checkboxes")

Click "Create Stack"

After about a minute, the stack status should be CREATE_COMPLETE:

![Creation complete](https://github.com/awslab/sagemaker-battlesnake-ai/raw/master/Documentation/images/create-complete.png "Creation complete")

Open the outputs tab and click on "Start Method" link to test that the deployment work:

![Output tab](https://github.com/awslab/sagemaker-battlesnake-ai/raw/master/Documentation/images/outputs.png "Output tab")

You should see:

![Successfull result](https://github.com/awslab/sagemaker-battlesnake-ai/raw/master/Documentation/images/working.png "Result")

Again on output tab, the value "Snake URL" is your Snake URL, you can use it on [BattleSnake](https://play.battlesnake.com/) !

Add your snake:
