## STEP 1 - Deploy a pretrained AI

This section will deploy a pre-trained AI on your AWS account. This AI will answer to the (see [BattleSnake API](https://docs.battlesnake.com/snake-api)). The architecture deployed will be:

![Pretrained Architecture](images/ArchitectureSagemakerBattleSnake.png "Pretrained Architecture")

> __Estimated cost__ : If you run this architecture for a limited time, it will fit in the [AWS Free tiers](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). The AWS Free tiers can support 500 000 snake API invokation on a 125 hours period per month on the first two months. The free tiers also include 250 hours per month of this notebook instance on the first two months.
> After the free tiers the charge will be $0.269 per hour ($6.5 per 24 hour period) of Sagemaker endpoint instance, $0.269 per hour of Sagemaker notebook instance and $6 per million Snake API call.
> __Saving tip__ : Once you have finished working (respectively participating to games) you can stop your notebook instance (resp. your endpoint instance) to stop consuming free tiers or occuring charge. You can restart them later to continue your work.
> See pricing details: [Sagemaker pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pricing/), [Lambda pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/), [API Gateway pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/pricing/)

_* You need to be logged into the AWS account where you want to deploy the stack._

_** the official BattleSnake platform run in us-west-2, selecting this one will provide you the lowest latency_

Leave all default value and scroll down at the end of the page. Then check all permissions:

![Accept Permissions](images/create-stack.png "Permission checkboxes")

Click "Create Stack"

After about a minute, the stack status should be CREATE_COMPLETE:

![Creation complete](images/create-complete.png "Creation complete")

Open the outputs tab and click on "Start Method" link to test that the deployment work:

![Output tab](images/outputs.png "Output tab")

You should see somthing like this:

![Successfull result](images/working.png "Result")

Again on output tab, the value "Snake URL" is your Snake URL, you can use it on [BattleSnake](https://play.battlesnake.com/) !

Add your snake on the [Battlesnake platform](https://play.battlesnake.com/) and copy your URL:

![Add snake](images/addsnake.png "Add snake")

Create a game, select your snake by his name, add opponents and start the game:

![Battlesnake Board](images/game.png "Battlesnake Board")
