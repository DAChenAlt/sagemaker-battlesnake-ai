## Deploy a pretrained snake AI into your AWS account

This section will deploy a pre-trained AI on a Lambda function. An API Gateway will be created in front of it to provide a snake API entrypoint (see [BattleSnake API](https://docs.battlesnake.com/snake-api)):

![Endpoint Architecture](images/SimpleEndpoint.png "Endpoint Architecture")

> __Estimated cost__ : this architecture is entirely Serverless and you pay nothing to deploy it, you will be charge only when you call the Snake. For a test usage this will be probably free because of the [AWS Free tiers](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). __If you call the snake less than 500 000 times in a month that should be free.__ After the free tiers every 1M Snake API call will be charged approximately 6$ (see [Lambda pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/) and [API Gateway pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/pricing/))

_* You need to be logged into the AWS account where you want to deploy the stack._

_** the official BattleSnake platform run in us-west-2, selecting this one will provide you the lowest latency_

Check all permissions:

![Accept Permissions](https://github.com/awslab/sagemaker-battlesnake-ai/raw/master/Documentation/images/create-stack.png "Permission checkboxes")

Click "Create Stack"

After about a minute, the stack status should be CREATE_COMPLETE:

![Creation complete](https://github.com/awslab/sagemaker-battlesnake-ai/raw/master/Documentation/images/create-complete.png "Creation complete")

Open the outputs tab and click on "Start Method" link to test that the deployment work:

![Output tab](https://github.com/awslab/sagemaker-battlesnake-ai/raw/master/Documentation/images/outputs.png "Output tab")

You should see:

![Successfull result](https://github.com/awslab/sagemaker-battlesnake-ai/raw/master/Documentation/images/working.png "Result")

Again on output tab, the value "Snake URL" is your Snake URL, you can use it on [BattleSnake](https://play.battlesnake.com/) !

Add your snake:
